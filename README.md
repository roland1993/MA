## Image Registration Experiments
First simple experiments for non-parametric image registration, written in **MATLAB**. Inspired by [**FAIR.m**](https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m), but not using it. Provides:

+ ### Distance Measures
  + SSD

+ ### Regularizers
  + Diffusive Energy
  + Curvature Energy

+ ### Optimization schemes
  + Gradient descent
  + Gau√ü-Newton optimization
  + Armijo line search
  + Support for Multi-Level strategy

+ ### Miscellaneous
  + Derivative test (1st + 2nd order) for multivariate functions

## Primal Dual Optimization
Convex optimization experiments with first-order primal-dual algorithm by [**Chambolle & Pock**](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00490826/document), written in **MATLAB**. Provides:

+ ### TV-L1 Image Denoising
+ ### TV-L2 and TV-L1 Image Registration
 
###### Note: Image Registration procedures use an iterative linear approximation of the image model to achieve a convex data term. Details can be found in [A Duality Based Algorithm for TV-L1-Optical-Flow Image Registration](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75759-7_62).

## Nuclear Norm Experiments
A new distance measure for parallel image registration of an arbitrary number of template images to one shared reference. The rough idea is to constrain the nuclear norm of the matrix of column-major images (i.e. templates and reference).
